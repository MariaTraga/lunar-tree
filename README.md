# Lunar Tree
Lunar Tree is an A.I. project game demo with 2D Pixel artstyle for my master thesis regarding the behaviour of animals based on their needs as well as their likeness towards the player.
In order for the game to be created, the Unity Engine 2020.3.2f1 was used.

## Project Features
The player can:
 - Manage a 2D farm , grow crops and harvest them. 
 - Purchase seeds and sell any produce to the shop for profit
 - Interact with various objects like trees and chests
 - Smart animals using the Behaviour Tree A.I. structure
 - Inventory system
 - Lighting effects
 - Day and night cycle
 - NPC dialogue system
